            <p>We believe in doing good through our work and are always looking for ways to operate more
sustainably and to do things better.</p>
<p>We behave and act in a socially and environmentally responsible manner at all times.
We are proud to work with a number of various local and national charities to help raise awareness
and funds through our events.  Each year we work with several UK charities including Diverse
Abilities, MacMillan, Cancer Research UK and Julia’s House.  Our MD has recently completed a five
day trek of the Great Wall of China to raise much needed funds for Julia’s House.  
We also use our kit and expertise to support these partners; and we enjoy stepping away from our
desks to participate in our volunteering programme - our latest venture was partaking in the National
Beach Clean.</p>
<p>When designing events, at the forefront of our minds is the environmental impact of the contributing
components. Where possible, we actively reduce or ban the use of single-use plastics.  We discourage
plastic straws, we install event recycling, push for using recyclable food containers and cups.  We also
encourage utilising water stations with recyclable cups or glass bottles rather than serving plastic
water bottles.  Where possible we donate leftover catering at events to registered food banks or
shelters.</p>
<p>On average over 23,300,000 straws, 16,000,000 water bottles and 7,000,000 coffee cups are used
daily and over 2,500 tonnes of food goes to waste.  However small our contribution is, we always try
to do our bit at all events we manage; and we encourage our clients and suppliers to do the same.
When feasible, we use recycled or reusable materials/equipment in our office environment
We hope that by being conscious of our actions we can start to make a small impact in the
community around us.</p>
